## Schema.org Export Pipeline

### Caching
Cache MIME type lookups and builder function results to avoid redundant computation during large batch exports. `MimeTypeMapper` already does O(1) dict lookup; caching builder outputs by input hash would help repeated entity exports.

### Streaming exports
Replace in-memory list accumulation in `SchemaOrgExporter` with a generator pattern so large exports don't blow up RAM. Priority once entity count exceeds ~100k.

### JSON-LD schema validation on export
Validate exported JSON-LD against the schema.org spec on write (e.g., via `pyld` or `rdflib`). Currently only Pydantic response model validation is in place (`e989a88`).

### Output size optimization
Compress or compact JSON-LD output — deduplicate `@context` blocks, use prefix shortening, or offer a `compact` flag on `SchemaOrgExporter`.

### JSON-LD context file generation
Generate a custom `@context` file that declares non-standard namespaces (e.g., `ml:hasFaces` added in the 2.0.0 refactor). Required for strict JSON-LD validators to accept custom properties without rejecting the graph. Pairs with the validation item above.

### Additional serialization formats
Support RDF/XML, N-Triples, and Turtle output formats via `rdflib`. Useful for linked-data consumers that don't accept JSON-LD.
